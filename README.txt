This folder contains R codes used to construct the "grandstanding score" and the replication codes for
hypothesis testing, tables and figures presented in my paper entitled "When Do Politicians Grandstand? Measuring Message Politics in Committee Hearings" 
forthcoming at the Journal of Politics. 

This folder includes seven R code scripts as follows:

1. Rcode1_BuildDoc2vecMatrix

2. Rcode2_GridSearch_KSVM

3. Rcode3.1_FitLearners_doc2vec

4. Rcode3.2_FitLearners_reg

5. Rcode3.3_FitLearners_tfidf

6. Rcode4_EBMA

7. R code for replication for all tables and figures presented in the paper as well as its online appendix 


The related data will become available for downloads at the Harvard Dataverse webpage for 
the Journal of Politics. Note that the grandstanding score was measured based on the corpus slightly 
larger that the sum of the statement-level data and the training data. Some of the statements 
in the original corpus were dropped when merging it to the existing covariate datasets and 
during the final clean-up before the merger.
